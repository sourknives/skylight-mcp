## [1.1.7] - 2025-12-30

### Fixed

- **Authentication**: Fixed email/password authentication to use correct `Basic base64(userId:token)` format instead of `Bearer token`. The Skylight API requires the user ID and token to be combined and base64-encoded for Basic auth.
- **Calendar Events**: Fixed `get_calendar_events` returning no events when querying a single day. The API treats `date_max` as exclusive, so we now add 1 day to ensure events on the end date are included.

### Changed

- Added debug logging for authentication flow to help troubleshoot login issues
- Added automatic retry on 401 errors for email/password auth (attempts re-login once before failing)

## [1.1.6] - 2025-12-29

- Initial public release
